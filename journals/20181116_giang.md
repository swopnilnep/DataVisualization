# First step of doing data visualization

## Import all neccessary packages

I started by importing packages as one should do. Since we were working with the CSV file, we will need pandas to read the data files. I also decided to import numpy to make calculations more easily, seaborn and matplotlib to plot different kinds of plots such as bar graph, histogram, scatter plot, line graph, and pie chart. 

I think people in class also use of these packages as well. I then looked at my datasets, and I found out that my dataset had the information for longtitude and lattitude of the location. I finally imported folium and folium.plugins to graph the locations of all the bikeshare stations in the google map. These graphs will make the visualization more efficiently because people can know what is the most popular stations, and lots of other things.

I think the first step is very important because it would guide people to go on the right track.
