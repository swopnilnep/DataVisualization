# Some other Data Visualizations

We continued doing some data visualization with different goal. We tried to answer the question about the gender by users (percentage). We also wrote the common function for both datasets and then plot the bar graph for each of the dataset. Here below is the code for this function:

[Gender by User](../images/journal_images/gender_by_user.png)

With the bar graphs, I observe that male ridership seems to be higher in Boston compared to NYC where male ridership is 80% with females being under 20%. In NYC, male ridership is a little above 60% and female ridership is also higher above 20%.
