# Overview of the data (Answer the first questions)

Before plotting any chart or graph, I found it be more efficient to create a function to handle plotting. The function uses seaborn and matplotlib packages. For example, I ploted the bar graph for the all the riders by genders in the both nyc.data,and boston.data. Therefore, it's more convient with writing a common function for both datasets and then plotted the bar graph for each.

After plotting both bar graphs about the rides by gender for both cities, I can easily observe that the number of the make bikeshare is higher third times as that of the female bikeshare. Moreover, all female and male are subscriber (annual member) and all unknown people are customer (24-hour pass or 3-day pass user - non-member).

The first steps of visualization is going well. Swop and I will do more data visualization on the next days to see what we can gain from both datasets.
