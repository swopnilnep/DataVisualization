# Preparing for Presentation Day

We met one last time at the library to run through the presentation together. We divided parts of presentation. I will do the Overview of Datasets and the Map parts. Swop will do the "What happens in a Day" part, interactive plot, and the conclusion. We tried to make the presentation easy to catch up with, so people can enjoy our presentation. 

Lastly, Swop and I will alternate going through each main points in our analysis. We want everybody to have fun and learn something from our presentation as well.

Hope people enjoy our presentation
