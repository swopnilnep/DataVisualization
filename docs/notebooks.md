# IPython Notebooks

To do the analysis, we have divided the technical part of the analysis according to the analysis sections in the main articles. Feel free to look under the hood of these IPython notebooks to go over how we did these analyses.

|Title | Description | Link |
|---|---|---|
| Overview of the Data | Here, we take a basic overview of the data. We divide the data by whether the riders were members, non-members, male or female and we oversee the general trends to find some interesting insights | [![img1](../images/link.png)](../notebooks/p1.html) | 
| What Happens in a Day | In this notebook, we look at everyday events that may seem insignificant and look at timeseries data; what happens in every hour of the day, how does that differ by day of week, or what about month of day. We look at seasonal trends and trends that are time dependant. | [![img2](../images/link.png)](../notebooks/p2.html) | 
| Looking from Above | This notebook is all about geographical data. We plot intersting visualizations into animated maps and oversee the trends and the use cases of where most of the bicycle usage tends to be. We also try to gain some insights into why that is the case. |[![img3](../images/link.png)](../notebooks/p3.html) | 
| From Here to There | Here, we take a look at networks and which stations people are more likely to visit one after the other. We also analyze the trends based on different parts of the city based on interactive graphs. | [![img4](../images/link.png)](../notebooks/p4.html) |
